# Brick safety

Goal: no custom build can ever leave the OP-1 unable to reach te-boot (the bootloader), because te-boot is what lets us reflash stock firmware. Everything below comes from te-boot v2.30 / firmware 246, by disassembly (`tools/ldr_dump.py --elf` + `bfin-elf-objdump`). Addresses are runtime addresses.

## TL;DR rules

1. **Custom packages never contain `te-boot.ldr`.** Build them with `python tools/build_package.py <unpacked_dir> <out.op1>`, which drops it and runs the guard. With no `te-boot.ldr` in the package, *neither* update path touches the bootloader (proof below).
2. **Every package must pass `python tools/verify_bootloader.py <file.op1>` before it goes on the device.**
3. **Package file names must not contain `FRC`**, which forces a bootloader rewrite. Never put a **`.KEY`** file on the OP-1 disk: it triggers irreversible OTP key programming. (`RBT` in the name only adds a reboot after the update, so it's harmless but best avoided.) The guard checks all of this.
4. **Install only through the te-boot menu:** hold COM while switching on, then "1. Upload firmware". Don't use the app-side update path (see "Path B"), which forces a bootloader rewrite whenever the package contains te-boot.ldr.
5. **Before any custom flash, check the unit's bootloader is v2.30** (shown on the te-boot screen), and **prove recovery once by flashing stock `op1_246.op1` through the te-boot menu**. With a v2.30 unit and the stock file name, te-boot skips the bootloader write (see "Decision logic").
6. Don't use te-boot "7. Factory reset" or "8. Format drive" during development. They wipe YAFFS2, including `/yaffs2/cmel_gamma.dat` and `/yaffs2/samsung.dat`, the display gamma calibration files.

## Update pipeline

### Path A: te-boot menu (te-boot `0x0006xx`–`0x0009xx`, update routine `0xefca`)
1. Scans the USB disk for files by name (strstr, case-sensitive):
   - `.KEY` leads to "Found KEY file...", key-file decryption, then **OTP key programming** through the Boot ROM `bfrom_OtpWrite` (`0xEF00001C`). Irreversible.
   - `.OP1` leads to "Found firmware package..."
   - name contains `RBT`: reboot after a successful update (`0x169ec`)
   - name contains `FRC`: **force flag = 1**
2. `0xefca(pkg, len, force)`:
   - CRC-32 of the package, then "Wrong CRC-32, aborting!" or "CRC-32 OK"
   - **unlinks the old `/yaffs2/te-boot.ldr` and `/yaffs2/OP1_vdk.ldr`**
   - LZMA decode and untar into YAFFS2 (`0xe8a0`, `0xede8`); on failure, "Decode failed, aborting!"
   - `access("/yaffs2/te-boot.ldr")` (`0x2350c`). **Only if the file exists**: "Updating te-boot...", then `0x1068(path, force)`
   - `access("/yaffs2/OP1_vdk.ldr")`. If present: "Writing firmware..." `0x1388`, then "firmware written."

### Path B: running app (OP1_vdk)
- At startup (`OP_Main`, around `0x19f0d0c`), "Found firmware..." calls the package routine `0x1a5dedc(buf, len, force=1)` with **force hard-wired to 1**.
- A second caller, the PC sync path (`pc_bf_sync.cpp`, `0x1a0a242`), passes force=0.
- `0x1a5dedc` mirrors path A: CRC, unlink both `.ldr` files, decode and untar, then `access("/yaffs2/te-boot.ldr")` (`0x1a5e062`). **Only if it exists** does it call the writer `0x19a1900(path, force)`.
- So on this path a package that contains te-boot.ldr **rewrites the bootloader every time, even when it's identical**.

### Decision logic: te-boot writer `0x1068` (app copy: `0x19a1900`)
The float-comparison helpers are ROM-style routines in L1. The direction of the `> 1.1` and `> 2.05` checks is inferred from the surrounding messages.
```
read up to 256 KB of /yaffs2/te-boot.ldr
if size >= 0x3ff00:                      "te-boot too large, abort..."      -> fail
if memmem(img, "te_boot_version:2.30") and !force:                         -> SKIP ("te_boot skipped.")
v = strtof(after "te_boot_version:")
if v > 1.1:  copy running unit's calibration block into img (after "Test results goes here:")
if v > 2.05: copy running unit's 54-byte CMEL gamma (from L1 0xff8029c6) into img after "CMEL gamma values:"
             (no marker in img and unit has gamma -> "No room for gamma calibration" -> fail)
if v < 2.3:  "version number %1.2f is too low."                            -> fail (no downgrades)
erase + program NAND boot blocks in 128 KB chunks (0x833c), pad 0xFF       -> "te_boot written."
unlink /yaffs2/te-boot.ldr
```
- In te-boot, the compared string is the *running* bootloader's own version. In the app copy, it's the version the app was built with (also 2.30).
- The write is **not atomic**: losing power or crashing mid-write leaves a half-written bootloader. That's the brick scenario.
- The bootloader image on each unit carries **unit-specific calibration**, merged in at write time. You can't reconstruct it from TE's file alone.
- NAND boot blocks are write-locked except in this routine: `nand.cpp` asserts `(block >= NUM_NAND_BOOT_BLOCKS) || !write_lock_enabled`.

### Why omitting te-boot.ldr is safe
- Both paths unlink `/yaffs2/te-boot.ldr` *before* untarring, and the writer unlinks it afterwards. So the stock steady state is "no te-boot.ldr on YAFFS2", and nothing reads it except the writer.
- Both paths gate the writer on `access(...) == 0`. With no file, the writer is never called.
- Verified: `tools/build_package.py` output decodes to the 117 stock entries minus `te-boot.ldr` (116), all byte-identical.

## Remaining risks / open questions
- ~~Does te-boot verify the app image?~~ **Resolved: no.** See `docs/app-boot-chain.md`. The app's L1 code is XTEA-encrypted with a key held in OTP, but nothing is authenticated. Patch only plain SDRAM blocks and carry the encrypted CALLBACK blocks over unchanged.
- **te-boot is reached before any app code runs.** The init DXE reads the COM key and either boots the app or falls into the te-boot menu, so a broken custom app can't block recovery.
- **App size limit:** the app may use NAND boot blocks 4–127 (≈15.5 MB). The flasher has no size check of its own, so `verify_bootloader.py` should enforce it. Stock is 2.2 MB.
- A failed custom **app** is recoverable only if te-boot still starts and accepts USB uploads. te-boot is independent of the app (the Boot ROM loads it from the NAND boot blocks), so this should hold. Prove it once with stock (rule 5).
- Last resort if te-boot itself is ever damaged: JTAG or the BF524 boot-mode pins. Whether either is reachable on the OP-1 PCB is unknown.
