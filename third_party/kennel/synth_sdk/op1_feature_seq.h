/*
 * kennel feature API, sequencer types (docs/feature-hooks.md "Sequencer types"): a feature that sets
 * op1_feature_t.seq adds a sequencer the OP-1 offers next to its stock ones (euclid, dots, oracle, peal).
 * The core (kennel/kn_seq.c) owns every R246 patch site and dispatches to the registered types:
 *   - name: the sequencer's name in the seq_types table of op1_factory.db and in saved sounds. The build writes the
 *     seq_types row (make_firmware.patch_db) whether the type is compiled in or shipped as a file. A name never
 *     changes meaning once released.
 *   - SeqIds::from_name (0x01A42A2E / 0x01A42BDC / 0x01A42CE0) maps the name to R246's type 3 (finger) and marks the
 *     type active for the current mode (synth / drum); SeqIds::name (0x01A422EC) gives the name back for type 3 while
 *     it is active, so the sound saves with it. A saved name with no registered type (its file missing or broken)
 *     runs as finger and keeps its name, so the sound does not halt the OP-1 and comes back when the file does.
 *   - PlayerManager::create_player case 3 (0x01A0D150) gets the active type's player(), finger's otherwise.
 *   - the screen replaces finger's in slot 0x2D while the type is the mode's sequencer; while it is shown, left /
 *     right (keyboard octave) are handled by the core and the encoders and other keys go to the type.
 *   - persistence is the type's own: its own SQLite table through R246's background saver (seq/seq_text.h
 *     sq_store_*), loaded on the first player() call. The table name, like the type name, never changes.
 * mode below: 0 synth, 1 drum. All callbacks except player() and midi_start may be 0.
