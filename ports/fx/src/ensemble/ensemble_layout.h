/* The ensemble's delay lines and kernel block, shared by ensemble.cc and
 * ensemble_bfin.S (plain #defines: the assembly includes it too).
 *
 * Two lines (the left and right inputs), each a no-wrap int16 array as the
 * plate's (plate_layout.h): a write pointer p moves down one sample per
 * sample, p in [0, EN_SIZE); the newest sample is at p, the one d samples
 * older at p + d. A write made while p < EN_REACH is mirrored EN_SIZE
 * further on, where it's read after p wraps. So every read is a plain
 * positive offset from p, and the L registers stay 0.
 *
 * Delays at 22050 Hz: EN_BASE (6.8 ms) +- the slow sweep (up to
 * EN_SLOW_MAX samples, 3.6 ms) +- the vibrato (EN_FAST_MAX); one more
 * sample for the interpolation. */
